# Prompts / AI Tools Used

This file documents any prompts or AI tools used during the development of the School Canteen Web App.

---

## AI Tools

- **ChatGPT (GPT-5 Mini)** – Assisted in writing code, debugging, creating README, and explanations.
- **GitHub Copilot** – Suggested code snippets, component structures, and helper functions.

## Prompts Used with ChatGPT

1. “I want my SnackCard component to display snacks dynamically using React and localStorage.”
2. “Help me structure my CanteenProvider context for managing students, snacks, and orders.”
3. “Provide a professional README file including setup instructions, libraries used, and mock data approach.”
4. “Write a PROMPTS_USED.md file listing AI tools and prompts used in this project.”
5. “Debug why snacks are not displaying in my React app with context and localStorage.”
6. “Improve my SnackCard UI with Tailwind CSS, hover effects, and responsive layout.”

## Notes on Copilot Usage

- Used **GitHub Copilot** suggestions for repetitive components like `SnackCard.jsx` and `OrderModal.jsx`.
- Copilot helped accelerate code writing but all final code was **reviewed and adjusted manually**.
